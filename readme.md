## Circuit setup:

connect the components as specified by the constants of the main.py file:

WORKER_LEDS -> GP17

PLANT_LEDS -> GP16

WORKER_BUTTON -> GP15

PLANT_BUTTON -> GP14

## Editing files:

### .ffz files:

Edit using Fritzing. The software is paid but you can find free versions online (it used to be free)

### .drawio files:

Go to [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) and open the file. You can edit it online and export it as a .png or .svg

## Todo:

- [x] Change the code to support a RGB LED for the worker lights instead of a standard LED (Harry and Mateusz)
- [ ] Develop procedure to measure the light intensity as for the handout
- [ ] Develop procedure to measure the soil moisture as for the handout
- [ ] calculate resistor values
- [ ] cover CAD
